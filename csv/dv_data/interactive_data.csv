From 2010 to 2015, we disregarded non-cash charges that Verizon booked to reflect reduced assumptions about the future return on its pension and other retirement plans. Verizon itself disregards these non-cash charges in its Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA presentation, because they distort its real financial results. In its 2010 report, the company changed its accounting method for pensions, and retroactively restated its pretax profits for 2009 and 2008. The restatement had little effect for 2009. For 2008, our report uses the profits actually reported in the company's 2008 report. Accelerated depreciation and amortization comprised most of the company's tax subsidies.
