# The Perfect Number

## Background
The federal corporate income tax rate in the United States is supposedly 35%, but the truth is that corporations rarely pay that amount. Many large companies pay well below this rate using loopholes and tax breaks, often the result of aggressive corporate lobbying and campaign support. This project visualized the data behind claims that reducing taxes will make the US more competitive with foreign nations and that companies will take their extra profits and reinvest them in their workforces. We used data from reports by the [Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy](https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/35percentfullreport.pdf) and the [Institute for Policy Studies](https://ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/EE17-final-embargoed-for-August-30.pdf).
