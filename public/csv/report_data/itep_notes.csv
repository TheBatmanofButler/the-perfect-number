The company reports noncontrolling interest income in each year. Pretax income was adjusted to exclude this income/loss. The Company has investments in Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) that generate low-income housing tax credits and rehabilitation tax credits. As stated in its tax footnote, “the Company's investments in these entities are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits over specified time periods.” The company realized federal and state income tax credits related to these investments of $8.774 billion from 2008 to 2015."

Verizon Communications,"The company reports noncontrolling interest income in all eight years. Pretax income was adjusted to exclude this income. From 2010 to 2015, we disregarded non-cash charges that Verizon booked to reflect reduced assumptions about the future return on its pension and other retirement plans. Verizon itself disregards these non-cash charges in its Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA presentation, because they distort its real financial results. In its 2010 report, the company changed its accounting method for pensions, and retroactively restated its pretax profits for 2009 and 2008. The restatement had little effect for 2009. For 2008, our report uses the profits actually reported in the company's 2008 report. Accelerated depreciation and amortization comprised most of the company's tax subsidies. In 2008 and again in 2010, the company divested substantial assets using a technique known as a “reverse Morris trust” transaction, saving an estimated $1.5 billion in federal and state income taxes."
VF,"Pretax income for 2009, 2010, 2014 and 2015 was adjusted upward for non-cash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets.

W.R. Berkley,"Because the company does not disclose U.S. and foreign pretax income, the study estimated foreign pretax income based on reported current foreign income taxes. Reported total current income taxes were adjusted in order to separate federal and state taxes. The lower rate in 2010 was primarily a result of unrealized investment gains that were recorded for book purposes but are not yet taxable and the deductibility of loss reserves that were recorded as book expenses in prior years.

The study also reversed non-cash impairments for the carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2008, 2009 and 2010."
Windstream,"The company's low tax rate in most years is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation writeoffs they enjoy on their property, plant, and equipment. The research and experimentation tax credit reduced taxes by $18.9 million from 2013 to 2015. From 2011 to 2015, we disregarded non-cash charges that the company booked to reflect reduced assumptions about the future return on its pension and other retirement plans."
